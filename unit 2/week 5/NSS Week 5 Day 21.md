Monday we covered User Personas, User Types, User Stories and Acceptance Criteria.

The assignment (as posted on the mailing list), is below.

-----------------------

Today's assignment:
Commit your list of user stories to your project in the doc directory (e.g. doc/user_stories.md)
The user stories should look like:

  >  As a \<user or actor\>
  >  In order to <accomplish goal X or achieve a given business value>
  >  I want to <perform an action>

Those articles use a variety of specific approaches for the story format, but the general theme is all the same: who, what and why.
